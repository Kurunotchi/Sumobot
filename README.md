Sumobot Description

This Sumobot code, created by Kurunotchi, is a custom-built robot designed for sumo robot competitions, where it aims to push opponents out of a ring. The robot features a compact and efficient design with the following key components:

Arduino Nano: The brain of the sumobot, providing the necessary processing power for controlling the motors, sensors, and logic of the robot.
Motor Driver (L298N): This motor driver is used to control the two DC geared motors, allowing for precise movement and speed adjustments in both forward and backward directions.
DC Geared Motors: These motors power the sumobotâ€™s movement, providing enough torque and speed to navigate and push opponents within the sumo ring.
Battery (18650): A rechargeable lithium-ion battery that powers the sumobot for extended operation, ensuring enough runtime during a match.
IR Sensor: The IR sensor helps the sumobot detect obstacles and detect opponents, allowing it to react intelligently and avoid crashing into walls or other objects.
Switch: A simple power switch for turning the robot on and off.
Ultrasonic Sensor (optional): An additional sensor that can be added for object or opponent detection. It uses sound waves to measure the distance to obstacles, providing another layer of situational awareness for the robot.
The sumobot is equipped with basic autonomous behavior, including movement, obstacle detection, and the ability to respond to opponent actions. The ultrasonic sensor (if used) enhances its ability to detect the opponent's position, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively.
